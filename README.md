# helloGradle
This is based off a tutorial from the Spring Guides, "Building Java Projects with Gradle".
I took the "start from scratch" option and took time to install Gradle. Setting the path
was rather difficult and I ended up downloading Homebrew and installing that way to ease
any confusion. The project includes two simple classes to generate a Hello World message
with the main class having a dependency on the Joda Time library from Maven Central's 
repository. I added dependencies to the gradle.build file, along with specifying a JAR
name and included a wrapper.
